When they reach the ranks of the faithful, the Janissaries, Sultan’s elite household troops, close in and finish the enemy with their devastating counter-charge led by their iron- willed officers. Dreaded Assassins from Alamut prowl in the winds of time, striking the enemy elites and leaders, while the Alchemists of the House of Wisdom unleash devastating weapons made deadly by their elemental mastery, capable of overcoming the defences of virtually any foe."

Though an understanding between the Church and the Sultanate on being co- belligerents against Jahannam exists, the commanders of these expeditions will tolerate no interference and do not hesitate to crush those who would hinder their mission. Resentment against the infidels who unleashed Gog and Magog runs deep in the Sultanate, and matters of honour are swiftly resolved with duels to the death. Woe to those who dare to hinder the mission of Those Who Believe."

Thus it is no wonder that in the year 1559 the Sword Congress of Vienna agreed to rebuild and fortify the city, and that a yearly tithe is to be sent to New Antioch by all the Faithful nations, though this levy is rarely in form of coin. Instead, endless supply trains of foodstuffs, tools, ammunition, weaponry, machinery and skilled workers and engineers come from across Europa and the Mediterranean Sea, as well as the African dominions."

To this day New Antioch has withstood eight great sieges and its famed walls, with their seventy-seven mighty towers, have never been breached. This is partly due to hundreds of anchorites, metallic battle shrines with devotees entombed within them, that are embedded into the walls, keeping a vigilant watch over the walls day and night."

These warbands are simply given commission by the Duke, and have to raise their own coin and muster their own forces.
