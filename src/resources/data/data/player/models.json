There they are dressed in the robes of dark devotion, lie on the altar and mutilate themselves to death by carving unholy runes into their flesh. The more wounds they can suffer before perishing, the more pleasing it is said their offering is. The most devout slice their own throats, trying to cut as deep as they can before their miserable life leaves them.<br/>Most such wretches go to their doom in the Lake of Fire, but some are reborn as Choristers after nine days. Their corpses lurch back to their feet, and finish their grisly beheading, and lift their severed heads that begin to sing hymns they have learned in the Inferno. From their self-inflicted wounds spurts cold blood that forms diabolic symbols and changes to match the words of their unholy chorale. They head towards the front lines driven by a call no living can hear and join the Heretic warband of their choosing.<br/>As their severed heads sing their agonising hymns, the minds of their enemies are filledwith visions from the Pits of Hell, weakening both the resolve and strength of thoseunfortunate enough to hear the dire song of a Chorister. Their hymns are often the firstthing a fresh recruit experiences on the battlefield, as their unholy voice rolls across thetrenches, proclaiming a never-ending prophecy of the final victory of Hell over Heaven.",
