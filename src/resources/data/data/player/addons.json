The Shrine Anchorite will then shatter the bones of the volunteer and carry the broken victim to the battle on its Wheel. Any attacks against the Anchorite are then taken by the volunteer instead of the Anchorite (using the Armour of the volunteer) until the volunteer has been taken Out of Action. Down result against the volunteer does not affect the Anchorite movement. Note that they are otherwise treated as a single model and share any BLOOD MARKERs from any source. A volunteer cannot make any ACTIONs or gain move -for obvious reasons. At the end of the battle, even if the Volunteer would have survived, the model dies and is removed from your Warband.",
