Their strain of the Black Grail is shunned byothers of their kind, and they are no longer welcome at Ekron, the City of Beelzebul. They arecast out from the Order of the Fly for their failure.

They seek lost artefacts and broken shards of armour and weapons of their lost liege, and fashion disturbing and rusted jewellery from these remains where the Hegemon’s power still lingers beyond the grave. Few things that haunt the No Man’s Land are more dangerous -or more ghastly than these corruption-ridden echoes of the dark past, the funeral processions that last until time itself is no more."
